## Questions

#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Through the different methods of testing you can ensure that your program is functional and secure.
By using both static and dynamic testing methods you can ensure that the program will be
error free. To achieve proper functionality and security for the program it is recommended to
beggin the testing phase before you start programming by using static methods and then apply
dynamic methods while programming.
#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs will be varied, depending on the end goal you need to adapt to meet user needs.
It is best figure out what the user needs before starting the development phase. After figuring
out the user needs you can then come up with requirements that need to be met and tested for
functionality.
#### How do I approach designing software?
When I am designing a software I like to first dig myself into the documentation of what 
I will be using to properly familirize myself with the tools I will be using. After familiarizing
myself I like to structure and plan out my project. When I start development I like to follow what I have planned
out. Before this course I never paid much attention to automated testing methods. The majority
of the testing I would do would be incorporated in the program and deleted later and they
were not complicated testing methods like the ones done during this course.
